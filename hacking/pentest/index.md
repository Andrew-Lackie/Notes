# Penetration Testing

## Types of Hacking

- [Web Hacking 爵](web_hacking/index.md)
- [Network Hacking ](net_hacking/index.md)
- [Linux Privilege Escalation](linux_priv_esc/index.md)
- [Windows Privilege Escalation](windows_priv_esc/index.md)

## Methodology

**Industry Standard Methodologies:**
- OSSTMM
	- The methodology focuses primarily on how these systems, applications communicate, so it includes a methodology for:
		1. Telecommunications (phones, VoIP, etc.)
		2. Wired Networks
		3. Wireless communications
- OWASP
	- The "Open Web Application Security Project" framework is a community-driven and frequently updated framework used solely to test the security of web applications and services.

- NIST Cybersecurity Framework 1.1
	
- NCSC CAF
	- The framework applies to organisations considered to perform "vitally important services and activities" such as critical infrastructure, banking, and the likes. The framework mainly focuses on and assesses the following topics:

    Data security
    System security
    Identity and access control
    Resiliency
    Monitoring
    Response and recovery planning



### Information Gathering

This stage involves collecting as much publically accessible information about a target/organisation as possible, for example, OSINT and research.

Note: This does not involve scanning any systems.

### Enumeration/Scanning

This stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems. For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable.

### Exploitation

This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic.

### Privilege Escalation

Once you have successfully exploited a system or application (known as a foothold), this stage is the attempt to expand your access to a system. You can escalate horizontally and vertically, where horizontally is accessing another account of the same permission group (i.e. another user), whereas vertically is that of another permission group (i.e. an administrator).

### Post-exploitation

This stage involves a few sub-stages:

1. What other hosts can be targeted (pivoting)

2. What additional information can we gather from the host now that we are a privileged user

3.  Covering your tracks

4. Reporting
